## Idea 0:

Toilet Ooze, your toilet is overflowing with various types of Ooze. Use different tools to keep it down (plungers, brushes, cleaning products).

## Idea 1:

The players have there own toilet, ooze is flowing out and increasing exponentially. Use the mouse to grab tools to target various oozes. Lose when it completely overflowed.

## Idea 2: 

In a more mario party style mini game, with a 4 player max group (idea prob wouldnt scale to well with many people). Each player takes turns (10 seconds?) to use the tools to keep the ooze down ( similar to idea 1 ). However, if the player goes too crazy with the tools the toilet starts to crack. If the toilet breaks or overflows that player loses. Repeat until you have one champion.

## Idea 3:

Your group of large cats panthers/pumas/lions/jaguars/idk is in a bathroom trying to keep the ooze down the various drains. The bathroom is setup like an obstacle course to get various items ( 2D top down ). The physics are slippery making it easy to fail an obstacle. This could easily scale for various player counts

## Idea 4

A room full of toilets
running around keeping the ooze down with a plunger at various toilets
you are panther that slips around on the floor as you run
last player wins

## Idea 5

Players are in a toilet bowl
Use tools to clear out the oooze blockage to go further down the pipe

## Idea 6

ooze coming out of toilets attacking your panther!
use cleaning tools to clean the panther
limited set of tools on the map for players to get
map is maze like
panthers are running in panic!

## Idea 7

ooze is escaping the toilet in center of the room
players are panthers, run around and kill the oozes.
you only have 3 ammo
you must pick up ammo items (plungers) on the ground
the floor has slippery spots
Time 60 seconds
Varying amount of oozes come out of toilet. Certain ones are worth more points
Panther with most points wins!
